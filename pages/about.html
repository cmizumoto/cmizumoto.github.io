        <section class="about__content">
          <ul>
            <h3 class="heading-3">Social Media / Community</h3>
            <li>
              Managed company's social media accounts, including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed and implemented social media campaigns to increase followers, likes, and
              engagement
            </li>
            <li>Created content for postings, including text, images</li>
            <li>Monitored and responded to customer comments and inquiries</li>
            <li>Analyzed analytics to measure success and reach of campaigns</li>
            <li>
              My greatest archievement was to lead the project to implement Discord to their
              services, configuring bots and server, creating workflows, assets, study cases,
              members usage data (messages, online peak, interests, power users). This was a hard
              project since we were the first region to try, later used as a model for other
              regions.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>

            <li>Maintain customer records</li>
            <li>Follow up with customers to ensure satisfaction</li>
            <li>
              My key archievement was bringing back the customer confidence for a company product,
              when I started working for a certaind company their ticket queue was at 5k requests.
              After couple months we averted the FTR and SLA by 24 hours, also brought back
              customers satisfaction, reflected in better sales and user retentions.

              Collaborated with other designers and developers to ensure successful completion of
              projects

            <li>
              My archievement during my internship was to design and code the company's new website.
              This wasn't a one person job, but no one was willing to help so I ended up doing
              everything by myself, in the process I learned new technologies and processes, the
              owner ended up liking the new website after some iterations.
